# WhatsNext

## What exactly is What's Next?
* What's Next is meant to serve as your one and only producitivity tool on your personal or work computer. By connecting to your logged in Google Chrome account, you will be able to store tasks that need to get done and sync them across all devices.

* On top of this, you'll be able to move tasks to another day, see what tasks you've already completed, and visualize your productivity as well. The extension is currently open source, and maintained by just one developer, so please be patient as fixes and new features are being released.

## Features 
* What's Next has a list of features that should help you reach your productivity peak

### Nested Tasks
* We know that not all tasks are created equal. Work is easiest completed when broken down to simpler, smaller, more manageable tasks, and What's Next seeks to accomodate this. Have a big presentation coming up? Break down research gathering, collecting data, and formatting slides all into their own tasks and subtasks, so that you know how much you've gotten done, and how much is still left to go.

### Carry Over Tasks
* In an ideal, all that we set out to do in a given day will always be completed on that day. But this isn't an ideal world, and life always seems to find a way to cut into what you wanted to accomplish. With Carry Over, you'll be able to quickly and seamlessly move tasks for today out to the next day or next week. Remember, we know you're only human, and What's Next makes sure to accomodate the setbacks in human nature :)

### Suggestions Box (in progress) 
* We know what we'd like in a productivity tool / To-Do list extension. But we also know our needs may not align with everyone else's, and that's okay. That's why we are working on a way for users to provide feedback to us about the product, and what you wish would be added/changed. For now, all suggestions should be suggested through Github, but we hope to soon have an easy link in the extension where you can submit your own changes

## _Early Development_ 
Please keep in mind that is in early development (pre-v1.0), so there is a chance that we may have some bugs and issues with the extension. However, rest assured that we will never put you at risk of compromising your personal data. All data will be stored locally dependent on your logged in Gmail account.This means that at no point will we be directly storing your data. With help from our friends at Google, we can guarantee that there is nothing to fear. If you still feel as though there may be a security risk of any kind, feel free to add suggestions via a new Issue.

_This is all that you need to know for now, we'll continue to add to this README as we go. Feel free to check back for new adds. Just check the readme version below to see if anythings changed since you've last been here_
